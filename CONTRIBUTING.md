# Contributing to the Iris Coq Development

Discussion about the Iris Coq development happens on the mailing list
[iris-club@lists.mpi-sws.org](https://lists.mpi-sws.org/listinfo/iris-club) and
in the [Iris Chat](https://mattermost.mpi-sws.org/iris).  This is also the right
place to ask questions.  The chat requires an account at the
[MPI-SWS GitLab](https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/users/sign_in) (use the "Register"
tab).

If you want to report a bug, please use the
[issue tracker](https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/FP/iris-coq/issues), which also
requires a GitLab account.  To contribute code, please send your MPI-SWS GitLab
username to [Ralf Jung](https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/jung) to enable personal
projects for your account.  Then you can fork the
[Iris git repository](https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/FP/iris-coq/), make your
changes in your fork, and create a merge request.
