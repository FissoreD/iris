# CONTRIBUTING TO THE IRIS COQ DEVELOPMENT

Discussion about the Iris Coq development happens on the mailing list
[iris-club@lists.mpi-sws.org](https://lists.mpi-sws.org/listinfo/iris-club).
This is also the right place to ask questions.

If you want to report a bug, please use the
[issue tracker](https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/FP/iris-coq/issues).  You will have
to create an account at the
[MPI-SWS GitLab](https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/users/sign_in) (use the "Register"
tab).

To contribute code, please send your MPI-SWS GitLab username to
[Ralf Jung](https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/jung) to enable personal projects for
your account.  Then you can fork the
[Iris git repository](https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/FP/iris-coq/), make your
changes in your fork, and create a merge request.
